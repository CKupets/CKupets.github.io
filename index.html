                  This it item 94 for UChicago SCAV 2018.
                  I made it in a few days in Unity using C#.
                  It is meant to be a "cookie clicker" style game where you play as President Zimmer managing the endowment.

                    These are the five movies I made for the NYU Sight an Sound: Filmmaking class in the Summer of 2017.
                    <br>We were encouraged to work in black and white and without sound in order to learn the basics of visual storytelling.
                    <br>Movies 4 and 5 have sound, and 5 also has a bit of color (it is also my favorite one).

                    This is a game I made as a final project for a summer social justice program.
                    <br>The art style is inspired by the murals of Chicago's Little Village neighborhood.
                    <br>The game is an autorunner where the character jumps automatically, the player must click to place platforms to support the character.

                    <br>I created the enivornments and coded the game logic for the MiniGame, BlockStack, and VRBlockStack scenes.
                    <br>While the game was meant to be played with a VR+Kinect system, it can be played with a mouse.
